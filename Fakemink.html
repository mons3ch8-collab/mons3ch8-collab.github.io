    <h1>Fakemink</h1>
    <ol>
      <ul>
       <li>Fakemink's music is a "sugar-high," "luxury rap" style that blends glitchy electronic textures, hyperpop elements, and UK jerk rap, creating a sound that is both nostalgic and disorienting</li>
       <li>Fakemink gained most of popularity from his songs "Easterpink" and "LV sandals" with EsDeeKid</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>My favorite fakemink songs are Cats, Makka, and fever</h3>
