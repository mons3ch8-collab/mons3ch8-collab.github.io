          <ul>
<li>EsDeeKids music mixes cloud rap, trap, and a punk-charged ethos, characterized by gritty production, offbeat flows, a thick Scouse accent,</li>
<li><p>His <strong>"Ok"</strong> tagline is so satisfying and the entire rebel album feels very chaotic in the best way possible</p></li>
 <li>A contributing factor to this rough and gritty production is his scouse accent, adding emphasis to certain words</li>
          </ul>
          </ol>
       <p>My personal favorites on this album are <em>4raws, Cali Man, and Mist.</em></p>
