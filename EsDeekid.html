     <h1>EsDeeKid</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>EsDeeKids music mixes cloud rap, trap, and a punk-charged ethos, characterized by gritty production, offbeat flows, a thick Scouse accent,</li>
            <li>His <p><strong>"Ok"</strong> tagline is satisfying and the entire rebel album feels so chaotic in the best way possible</</p>li>
              <li>A contributing factor to this rough and gritty production is his scouse accent, adding emphasis to certain words</li>
        </ol>
