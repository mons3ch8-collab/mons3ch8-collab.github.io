<h1>Welcome to Alpaca Adventures</h1>
<p>Alpacas live in the mountains of Peru and are known for their soft wool and gentle
personalities. They travel in groups called herds.</p>
  </div> <!-- This div was missing a closing tag. This interferes with the code by grouping other elements meant to be outside of the div, inside of it. Furthermore this disturbed the organization of the css, causing styling errors--> 
<div id="wool" class="section dark"><!-- Required quatation marks in the id and class attributes were missing. Deprived of them, it could be invalid html code, causing errors. In addition to this the code would not know what was apart of the attributes, or could include one word but not the other as part of it.-->  
<h2>Wonderful Wool</h2><!-- I added a missing slash in the closing tag of the h2. This is required, since unwanted elements outside of the heading would be interpreted as a part of it.-->
<p>Alpaca wool is light, warm, and water-resistant. It's sheared every year to make cozy
Clothing.</p> <!--/ I added the missing p tag. This p tag allows for the information inside of it to be displayed on the website. --> 

<div class="wool-box">
<p>This box demonstrates <strong>absolute positioning</strong>.</p>
<div class="wool-detail">
<p>I'm a smaller box positioned inside the larger one!</p><!-- Here I moved the start of  a p tag down 2 spaces, as it was beginning too early, before the div tag. This was necessary because that was inaccurate html code and div tags should not be placed inside of p tags, this caused it to appear as an extra p tag.-->

<h2>The Herd Life</h2>
<p>Alpacas are social animals and hum to each other to communicate. They also have a
leader that helps keep order in the group.</p>

<div id="fun" class="section dark">
<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alpacas can live up to 20 years. <!-- Here I put the closing <li> tag in it's correct position, before it was down 2 spaces. This hinders the code, as it confuses it on what is in the list and what is not, making the items appear merged.--> 
<li>They rarely spit at people ‚Äî only other alpacas!</li>
<li>Each alpaca has a unique ‚Äúhum‚Äù sound.</li> <!-- I removed the extra closing list tag, or I moved it in its correct position above. Extra tags are redundant and increases the risk of a bug in one's code.-->
